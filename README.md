# quizzApplication
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This app is targeting exam students
---------
The purpose of the application is to collect the unsolved questions in a database and return to the questions again.

After the questions are solved, questions deleted from the database.

In this way, it is aimed not to leave any unresolved questions.

What I want from those who want to develop this project:

1-) More useful interface.

2-) New targets for solving questions.

3-) And most importantly!! New ideas.
